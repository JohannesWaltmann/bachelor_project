\section{Introduction}
During the last years the usage of smart-wearables (particularly smartwatches) has become more and more common with a number of 337 million units sold in 2019 and a forecast in sales of up to 527 million units by 2024 \cite{tenzer}.
With that also comes a natural demand in data protection due to the many sensors built in these devices due to their ability to capture sensible personal information (e.g. health informations) and additionally the fact that smart devices also can now be used for many kinds of financial actions.\newline
Since most wearables are connected to either the distributors or the respective mobile phones virtual assistant they should contain sensors for on one hand sound conduction and on the other hand audio recording.\newline
Based on these conditions smartwatches could be used in combination with biometric authentication mechanics.\newline
In general biometric authentication can be split into behavioural and physiological biometrics as well as authentication can be split into implicit and explicit methods. The exact characteristics will be described as follows: 
\subsection{Biometrics}
\textit{Biometrics} (as in the greek terms \textit{bios} and \textit{metrikos}) describes the utilization of an individuals physical traits or behaviour to clearly identify one from others. Contrary to the more known verification methods as PINs, passwords or ID-cards biometric identification does not rely on tokens or knowledge which could easily be forgotten or stolen, rather than unique personal traits like fingerprints, face or the specific way someone interacts \cite[chpt. 1.1]{jain2007handbook}\cite{delac2004survey}. Therefore the individual wishing to authenticate first has to enrol one specific trait of hers to the biometric system. Based on this sample data the system generates an authentication template which is later on used to authenticate against.\newpage\noindent  
When someone now wants to register using the system he provides the trait wanted to the system from which then a new sample is generated. The generated sample then is compared to the template \cite{alsaadi2015physiological}.\newline
Tests used for this comparison can be designed based on two different points of view. First of positive identification or authentication and second negative identification/authentication. Negative authentication presumes the given sample is from an unknown user whereas the sample in a positive authentication scenario should be by a known user \cite{wayman2005introduction}.
As already stated above biometric authentication uses an individuals personal traits as authentication tokens. Based on the kind of trait and the methods how they could be provided the general term of biometrics can be further divided into \textit{behavioural} and \textit{physiological} biometrics. How each of them is defined exactly will be defined in the following.
\subsubsection{Behavioural Biometrics} Behavioural biometrics refers to authentication systems in which process of authentication is conducted with the use of primarily gestures or other actions able to be performed in everyday life. Usable features for this purpose are e.g. gait or keystroke analysis. Advantages this kind of biometrics has are e.g. that there is no direct need for special hardware since it is mostly used with smart wearables or mobile phones who each have the required sensors built in. Another advantage would be that the data required must not be collected actively by the user but is recorded passively by the sensors of the used smart device \cite{yampolskiy2008behavioural}.
\subsubsection{Physiological Biometrics} Apart from behavioural biometrics there is also the classification of physiological biometrics. This form of biometric authentication uses the more "static" traits of a users body as tokens such as e.g. fingerprints, hand geometry, vein patterns \cite{alsaadi2015physiological}, \cite{faltaous2019vpid}. A physiological system should also have a little higher accuracy than a behavioural one and it should be harder to use as an imposter since it is nearly impossible to identically copy a finger print, iris pattern, etc. \cite{koong2014user}, \cite{delac2004survey}.

\subsection{Authentication} 
A further subdivision which can be made in the context of authentication is between explicit and implicit authentication. By \textit{explicit}  authentication one understands interactions with a security system which are performed actively. This includes providing knowledge like PIN or password, using a token but also performing gestures, fingerprints etc. from the biometrical field.\newline 
Work presented by Shi et al. states that \textit{implicit} authentication would be a perfect fit for usage in combination with mobile devices \cite{shi2010implicit}. Since users are using their devices on slightly different habits everyday the data collected by built-in sensors alternates between individuals but stays the same for one person. Exploiting this they propose three application scenarios for the use of implicit authentication.\newline
First as a second factor in combination with passwords, second as the main authenticator and thus replacing the usage of a password and last as additional assurance or an extra trust factor when performing financial actions on a mobile device.

\section{Related Work}
Major influence towards this work comes from Schneegaß et al. works on functional biometrics as a novel kind of biometric authentication \cite{schneegass2020functbiometric} and one of its first realizations with SkullConduct \cite{SkullConduct}. These and other works on smart device based biometric authentication will be described in this section.\newline
As mentioned above Schneegaß et al. introduced a novel kind of biometrics named \textit{functional  biometrics}. This category subordinates to physiological biometrics since its key feature is the usage of body reflections.

\end{figure}
\newline
With functional biometrics the authentication system provides an additional stimulus during the enrolment phase. This stimulus is applied to the individuals body where it gets modified and afterwards captured (Figure~\ref{fig:functBiom}).
Due to different personal biological characteristics the modification of the stimulus is unique for each combination of user and stimulus.\newline
Requirements Schneegaß et al. proposed are two hardware components in form of a Stimulus Generation Unit (SGU) and a Body Reflection Sensor (BRS). These two have to be designed as a dependence of the underlying biometric trait. Exemplarily when sound is used as the stimulus the SGU will be most likely some kind of microphone and the BRS a speaker.\newpage\noindent
During the enrolment process described above stimulus and its transformation are saved as a secret two-tuple ($x, f(x)$) with $ x $ being the stimulus and $ f(x) $ the transformation. Now when the related user wants to authenticate the stimulus is reapplied and it is expected to get $f(x)$ as response again. An additional security measure provided by functional biometrics is that when the stimulus gets leaked or lost the system is not fully compromised because the stimulus is only an exchangeable medium. The secret stems from the body reflection function which is unique to the user, unknown and hard to manipulate.
